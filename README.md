# Masonite Lean Engineering Internship – Summer 2024

Lean Engineer Intern – Continuous Improvement (CI) Team, May 20 – July 30, 2024

Completed Kaizen training at Janesville, WI, learning lean principles such as the 10-step Kaizen process, standard work, takt time, work balance, 5S+1, Kanban, and value stream mapping, applying them through simulations and a mini Kaizen event.

Main project addressed low and inconsistent On Time & Complete (OT&C) scores (70.9%) and productivity issues on the 90-minute Fire Door line at the DFC Dallas plant. Goals included raising OT&C to ≥92% and UPMH above 1.57.

Methodology: Applied the Kaizen process, time studies, workload balancing, and visual management tools, using Excel, and Standard Work Combination Sheets.

## Key Implementations 

1. Scheduling Board – Leveled production and standardized weekly tasks.
2. 5S+1 Improvements – Created organized staging areas, eliminated trip hazards, and reduced injury risk.
3. Standard Work & SOPs – Balanced workloads, increasing throughput.
4. Leader Standard Work (LSW) – Standardized daily routines for team leads.

## Results

UPMH: 1.50 → 1.77 (+18%)

UPH: 5.6 → 6.2 (+10.7%)

OT&C: 73.9% → 81.6% (+10.4%)

5S+1 Score: 23 → 27 (+17.4%)

Overall, delivered measurable improvements in productivity, quality, and workplace organization through lean methodologies.
